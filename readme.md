# Buzzer Game

This is my first attempt at writing a buzzer game from scratch.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    If there are any dependencies, install them using npm or yarn. For example:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the WebSocket server:**
    Ensure you have a WebSocket server running on `ws://localhost:8080`. You can use a simple Node.js WebSocket server or any other WebSocket server implementation.

4. **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```

5. **Join the game:**
    - Enter your name in the input field and click "Join Game".
    - Once joined, the "Buzz In!" button will be enabled.

6. **Buzz in:**
    - Click the "Buzz In!" button to buzz in.
    - The first user to buzz in will be announced.
